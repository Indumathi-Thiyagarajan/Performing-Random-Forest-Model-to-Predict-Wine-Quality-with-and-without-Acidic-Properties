 Many wine experts argue that acid is a vital component of wine.
 First we build linear regression model, logistic regression model and random forest model to determine the model that has higher accuracy based on AUC value. 
 We found that Random Forest Model is the one with better AUC value
 Build and evaluate "two" random forest models to predict wine quality using (i) all available predictor variables and (ii) all but acidity measures (fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, and pH).
 Based on your analysis, We agree that acid is a significant predictor of wine quality (sensory preference)
